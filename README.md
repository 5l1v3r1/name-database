# The Open Name Database Project

This project aims to provide a list of names and associated meta-data, such that you as a developer can produce software that will generate random names in your own software.

## Motivation

So I go to start working on a video game that relies heavily upon procedurally generated content.  One part of this is the need to procedurally create NPCs, and those NPCs need names.  A little browsing on the internet, and a lot of online name generators later, I come to find that people with name lists seem to keep them close to the vest.

This project aims to change that.
